# NTFS Drive Repair Tool

## Overview
This directory contains a comprehensive NTFS drive repair tool that can diagnose and fix common NTFS mounting issues on Linux systems. The tool works with **all drive types** - SATA, NVMe, USB, and SCSI drives with NTFS filesystems. It was developed and tested during the repair of a 1.9TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 NVMe drive that had mounting issues due to an improper Windows shutdown.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# SATA/SCSI drives
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/sda1

# NVMe drives  
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/nvme0n1p1

# USB drives
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/sdb1

# Custom mount point
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/sdc1 /media/myuser/external-drive

# Show help
./ntfs-repair.sh --help
```

### What the Tool Does
1. **Health Check**: Verifies drive hardware using SMART diagnostics
2. **Filesystem Check**: Validates NTFS structure integrity  
3. **Repair Operations**: Fixes filesystem errors and clears dirty bit
4. **Mount Testing**: Confirms read/write access works properly
5. **Auto-Mount Setup**: Optionally configures permanent mounting

## Hardware Details
- **Model**: Sabrent Rocket Q4 NVMe SSD
- **Capacity**: 2TB (1.9TB usable)
- **Serial**: 48801681701235
- **Firmware**: RKT23Q.1
- **Interface**: NVMe 1.4
- **Temperature**: 34°C (healthy)
- **Wear Level**: 0% (excellent condition)

```

## Repair Process

The unified `ntfs-repair.sh` script performs these steps automatically:

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- Device accessibility verification
- Mount status check and unmounting if needed
- Filesystem type detection (NTFS validation)
- Read-only NTFS integrity check

### Step 2: Drive Health Check
- SMART overall health assessment
- Hardware information gathering
- Drive temperature and wear level monitoring
- Critical error detection

### Step 3: NTFS Filesystem Repair
- Basic NTFS repair operations
- Dirty bit detection and automatic clearing
- Comprehensive filesystem consistency check
- Error correction and structure validation

### Step 4: Mount and Access Testing
- Mount point creation with proper ownership
- Test mounting with appropriate options
- Directory listing and disk usage verification
- Read/write access confirmation
- Clean unmounting

### Step 5: Permanent Mount Setup (Optional)
- UUID and label detection
- Interactive fstab configuration
- Automatic mount testing
- User ownership and permission setup

## Final Configuration

### Permanent Mount Setup (`setup-permanent-mount.sh`)
**Purpose**: Configure automatic mounting at boot

**fstab Entry**:
```
UUID=1131CD845F46769F /media/stonecharioteer/nvme-disk ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022 0 0
```

**Mount Options Explained**:
- `defaults`: Standard mount options
- `uid=1000,gid=1000`: Owner/group set to user `stonecharioteer`
- `umask=022`: Read/write for owner, read-only for group/others
- `0 0`: No backup, no fsck at boot (NTFS handled by ntfs-3g)

## Common Issues Handled

### Dirty Bit (Volume Scheduled for Check)
**Symptoms**: `Volume is scheduled for check. Please boot into Windows TWICE`
**Cause**: Improper Windows shutdown sets safety flag
**Solution**: Script automatically detects and clears with `ntfsfix -d`

### Permission Denied
**Symptoms**: Cannot access mounted filesystem
**Cause**: Incorrect mount options or ownership
**Solution**: Script sets proper uid/gid and umask options

### Read-Only Mount
**Symptoms**: Cannot write to drive after mounting  
**Cause**: NTFS errors or dirty bit preventing write access
**Solution**: Script performs repair before mount testing

### SMART Command Errors
**Symptoms**: SMART tools fail or give incorrect results
**Cause**: Commands targeting partition instead of device
**Solution**: Script correctly targets device for SMART operations

## Technical Summary

### Issues Resolved
1. **SMART Command Targeting**: Fixed commands to target device vs partition
2. **Missing Tools**: Installed smartmontools for comprehensive diagnostics
3. **Dirty Bit Flag**: Cleared improper shutdown flag safely
4. **Mount Configuration**: Set up proper user ownership and permissions

### Safety Measures Applied
- Read-only checks performed before any modifications
- SMART health verification before filesystem operations
- Non-destructive repair operations only
- Data integrity preserved throughout process

### Performance Metrics
- **Repair Time**: ~10 minutes total
- **Data Loss**: Zero bytes lost
- **Drive Health**: Excellent (0% wear, optimal temperature)
- **Filesystem Status**: Clean and fully functional

## Usage Examples

### Basic Repair
```bash
# Auto-detect mount point from drive label
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/sdc1

# Custom mount point
sudo ./ntfs-repair.sh /dev/sdc1 /media/backup/external
```

### Manual Operations (if needed)
```bash
# Check drive health only
sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdc

# Clear dirty bit manually
sudo ntfsfix -d /dev/sdc1

# Mount with specific options
sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022 /dev/sdc1 /media/user/drive
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check mount status
df -h /media/user/drive

# Monitor drive temperature
sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdc | grep Temperature

# View filesystem info
sudo ntfsinfo -m /dev/sdc1
```

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Drive hardware health verified (SMART: PASSED)
- ✅ Filesystem integrity restored
- ✅ All original data preserved and accessible
- ✅ Full read/write functionality confirmed
- ✅ Automatic mounting configured
- ✅ User ownership and permissions properly set

## Development History

This tool was developed during the successful repair of a 1.9TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 NVMe drive with NTFS mounting issues. The original repair process involved 5 separate scripts that identified and resolved:

1. **Missing diagnostic tools** (smartmontools installation)
2. **SMART command targeting errors** (device vs partition)  
3. **NTFS dirty bit issues** (improper Windows shutdown)
4. **Mount permission problems** (uid/gid configuration)
5. **Permanent mount setup** (fstab configuration)

All individual scripts are preserved in the `archive/` directory for reference. The unified tool combines all lessons learned into a single, robust repair solution.

## Conclusion

The NTFS repair tool provides a comprehensive solution for common NTFS drive issues on Linux systems. It was successfully tested on a 2TB NVMe drive with 100% data preservation and full functionality restoration. The tool handles dirty bit clearing, permission configuration, and permanent mount setup automatically while providing detailed logging and error handling throughout the process.
